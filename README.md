# phonebook
A fun and short project to familiarize myself with Python's dictionaries

Functionalities: while True, program keeps prompting for user's request:
- 1: search (in existing phonebook's directory)
- 2: add names and numbers (secondary prompt)
- 3: quit -> break out of while loop

Added the ability to store more than 1 phone number to the same name. As I print out the directory = {} I will see that 'name' test1 has 2 numbers attached.
Presented as list inside dictionary pair. In this case, key 'test1' has a value paired of a list of ['001', '009']
